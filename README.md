# Psychic-Game

## Overview

This is a letter guess game. The [project start page](https://cnikolai.github.io/Psychic-Game) can be found here. 

### Problem 
This problem is a game where the user tries to guess a letter that the computer is "thinking of."  The user gets a predetermined number of guesses, in this case 9.  The computer chooses a random letter from the array of the alphabet.  The user then proceeds to guess a letter.  When the user guesses a letter from a to z, it is matched against the letter to guess.  If the guesses correctly, the user wins.  If the user guess incorrectly, the user loses, we print out the win/loss stats.  The user can choose to play again.  

### How I solved it
This game uses only frontend technology.  

### Technical Approach
I solved this problem by using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript. I used HTML to create the structure of the page.  I used CSS to style the page.  We use JQuery to edit and append the elements of the DOM.
